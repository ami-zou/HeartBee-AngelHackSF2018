# HeartBee-AngelHackSF2018
(A Fitbit App + Web App + iOS Mobile App): Heartbee allows you to take care of your loved ones by providing a dashboard of your family’s heart rates as relayed by the Fitbit watch

========Story=============

San Francisco Chinatown is full of elderly citizens like my grandmother. And according to the statistics, more than 70% of them suffer from cardiovascular disease. We want to connect elderly parents and their family members in a way that doesn’t intrude on their independence, but make sure they’re being taken care of.

We chose to use a Fitbit watch. 

Heartbee allows you take care of your loved ones by providing a dashboard of your family’s heart rates as relayed by the Fitbit watch.

======Development=========

Using Fitbit’s API, we created a demo of the watch you’d give your elderly parents to wear. They can track their current heart rate, receive messages, and call for help if need be. When their heart rate reaches above a certain threshold, a notification is send to their family member.

Using AWS, we created the dashboard for family members and caregivers. We can check on elderly parents, send messages, track their heart rates and locations, using Fitbit sensors and Hypertrack.
We can also see the health score of our family members, aka our “hive”.

In conjunction, these two apps work together to keep everyone updated on the health status of their loved ones and keep everyone in check.

Although we designed for Fitbit Ionic and web this app can easily be scaled into a tablet or mobile app. The mobile app will have a video chatting function using Agora to help elderly seniors communicate with their family members in every way possible.

This app is targeted to people with elderly parents at risk of heart attacks. So if you or someone you know has a elderly loved one you care about, give them the freedom they need but also the peace of mind you need, with Heartbee.
